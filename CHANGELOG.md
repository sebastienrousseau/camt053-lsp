# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Document symbols (outline)** — a `document_symbols` helper and a
  `textDocument/documentSymbol` handler that produce one symbol per record
  (named `Record N`, with `statement_msg_id` / `entry_ref` as detail) and a
  child symbol per field, each with a best-effort line number. Malformed JSON
  yields an empty outline
- **Formatting** — a `format_text` helper and a `textDocument/formatting`
  handler that pretty-print the document with a stable 2-space indent while
  preserving key order, returned as a single full-document `TextEdit`. Invalid
  JSON leaves the document unchanged
- **JSONC tolerance** — a dependency-free pre-step strips `//` line comments and
  trailing commas before parsing, so diagnostics, symbols, and formatting all
  work on JSONC data files. Clean JSON behaviour is unchanged

### Deferred

- YAML data-file support is noted as a future enhancement and is not yet
  implemented (no YAML dependency added in this release)

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Initial release of `camt053-lsp`, a [pygls](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls)-based
  Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for authoring camt053 reversing-entry
  data JSON files (Python 3.10+)
- A `camt053-lsp` console entry point that starts the language server over
  stdio for editor LSP clients
- **Diagnostics** — schema validation of each record against a message
  type's input JSON Schema (missing required fields, types, patterns) plus
  IBAN / BIC validation of identifier fields
- **Completion** — every input field (with its schema description) and the
  full list of supported camt message types
- **Hover** — schema descriptions for the field under the cursor
- Pure, importable helper functions (`compute_diagnostics`,
  `completion_items`, `hover_text`) backed by the shared `camt053.services`
  layer, so editor behaviour matches the CLI, REST API, and MCP server
- Part of the **camt053 suite** alongside the core `camt053` library and the
  `camt053-mcp` Model Context Protocol server
